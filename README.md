# About Geoservices
This project is a web service that provides the address from coordinates.

## Why would I need this?
This address information is also possible to fetch from paid web services, or web services that throttle the requests.
By deploying the service on your home server you can use it without limits or additional costs.

## How does it work?
The web service comes with a simple web page to fill out coordinates
![geoservice-ui](https://github.com/jeltechnologies/geoservices/assets/153366704/d64a41e8-b9ae-4841-bfa3-060d8a43c5c6)

The web service responds in JSON
![geoservice-rest](https://github.com/jeltechnologies/geoservices/assets/153366704/3ae5b373-c117-4831-9b8b-911c72258397)
Change the URL to where the web service is deployed, for example http://localhost:8080/geoservices

Use the following parameters for the web service 
- latitude for the latutide and longitude for longitude or
- or latlon for comma seperated latitude and longitude
