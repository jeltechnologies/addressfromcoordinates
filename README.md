# About Geoservices
This project is a web service that provides the address from coordinates.

## Why would I need this?
With this service you can use geolocation information for free, without limits.
You can run this service self-hosted, on your own server, or in the cloud.

Cloud services that provide the same service limit require sign up, thrhttole requests to 1 per second and cost easily 30 â‚¬ per months. The cheaper cloud services most likely use the same data sources as this service.

## How does it work?
The address service is provided as REST interface with a JSON payload.

Use the method `GET geoservices/address` with following parameters:
- `latitude` for the latutide and `longitude` for longitude or
- `latlon` for a comma seperated latitude and longitude

Then web service responds in JSON

Change the URL to where the web service is deployed, for example `http://localhost:8080/geoservices`.

The service also comes with a simple web page, for testing puproses. Here you fill out coordinates

## Accuracy
The accuracy of the service varies per country. The accuracy is excellent in North America, China and  most European countries. There are exceptions. For example the accuracy is less good in Sweden, because there is less quality open data available.

# Installation and configuration
To run the geoservice you will need:
- A Java web container, preferably Apache Tomcat
- PostgreSQL database server, which will be used to store more than 100 million addresses. Create an empty database with the name "geoservices"
- Download the PostgrSQL JDBC driver (https://jdbc.postgresql.org/), which must be placed in tomcat/lib
- Create a JNDI resource to the PostgreSQL database with the name `jdbc/geoservices`. This is configured in Tomcat in conf/context.xml. 
- Example context.xml:
 ```
  <Resource 
		name="jdbc/geoservices" 
		auth="Container"
		type="javax.sql.DataSource" 
		username="******"
		password="******" 
		url="jdbc:postgresql://<server:port>/geoservices"
		driverClassName="org.postgresql.Driver"
		initialSize="10" 
		maxTotal="25"
		maxIdle="5"
		defaultAutoCommit="false"
	/>
  ```

## Configuration
- Create a YAML file with the following contents, change the dataFolder to the location where you store the data files.
- ```
  dataFolder: C:\Projects\Geoservices\data
  refreshOpenStreetDataCSV: false
  cache:
    useCache: true
    maxCacheSize: 150000
    expiryTimeMinutes: 2
    scheduleCacheCleanMinutes: 5
  ```
- Create an environment variable called `GEOSERVICES_CONFIG` which points to the YAML configuration file.

# Data files
The service uses data from both Opendatasoft and Openstreetdata. The data from Opendatasoft is mandatory, while Openstreetdata is optional. More data means more accurate results.

## Opendatasoft
Download the following files from Opendatasoft and place them in your dataFolder. The files from Opendatasoft are mandatory. Without these files the geoservice does not work.
- 142 thousand cities from https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/table/?disjunctive.cou_name_en&sort=name (download the CSV file)
- 1.5 million postal codes from https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-postal-code/export/ (download the CSV file)

## Openstreetdata
The geoservice has been tested with all houses files from Openstreetdata, which are 109 million house addresses. Optionally download houses information Openstreetdata. More houses files means better accuracy, but larger memory consumption. 
- Download the houses files from https://openstreetdata.org/#addresses. The streets and addresses files are not needed.
- Unzip the `*-houses.tsv.gz` to `*.houses.tsv` and copy them to the dataFolder.

# For the nerds

## Performance
The performance depends on the CPU used. The system is designed to supports multiple requests in parallel. Threading is handled by the web container and/or cloud infrastructure. 
A built-in cache is used to improve performance for lookups of series of pictures taken at the same location. This cache is configured in the YAML file.

## Startup performance
The first time the service starts, all .tsv files and insert them into the PostgreSQL database. This can take around 30 minutes to complete. After this the next startup will take just a few minutes because all data is read from the database. To force a reload of the .tsv files, you may set `refreshOpenStreetDataCSV` to `true` in the YAML file, or simply drop all database tables and restart the web service.

## Memory usage
Coordinates are kept in memory, 109 million house addresses will take around 8 GB of heap memory. To reduce memory usage, simply remove houses files you do not need.
